ðŸ”§ Introduction to Wireframing
ðŸ“Œ What Is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. Itâ€™s like a blueprint that shows where major elements such as navigation, content blocks, images, and buttons will appearâ€”without focusing on design details like color, font, or final graphics.

Wireframes are typically black and white or grayscale and are used early in the design phase to outline structure and functionality.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Wireframing Is Important
Clarifies layout and structure: Wireframes help designers and stakeholders agree on placement of content and features before any visual design or coding begins.

Improves user experience (UX): It focuses attention on usability, navigation flow, and interaction without the distraction of visuals.

Saves time and resources: Catching layout or UX issues early in the wireframe stage is much faster and cheaper than fixing them after design or development.

Enhances team communication: Wireframes provide a common visual language for designers, developers, and clients.

âœ… Summary
Wireframing is a critical step in the design process that helps turn ideas into structured layouts. It enables clear communication, faster iterations, and better user experiencesâ€”making it an essential practice for any successful web or app project.
